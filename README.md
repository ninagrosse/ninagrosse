## Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Nina

Software-Developer by day. DJ by night.

At work I'm mostly coding in Java (plain Java, good old Swing, Spring, Spring-Boot with OpenAPI, JSF). I'm also part of our CI/CD- and DevOps-Team. Currently I'm getting more into JavaScript and React to facelift our front-ends.

On the weekends I'm regularly DJ'ing. My music of choice is Drum'n'Bass. You can check my [linktree](https://linktr.ee/soniqdnb) for more DJ stuff.

## Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Nina

Software-Developer by day. DJ by night.

At work I'm mostly coding in Java (plain Java, good old Swing, Spring, REST with Spring-Boot, JSF). Currently getting more into JavaScript, React and Next.js to facelift our front-ends.

On the weekends I'm regularly DJ'ing. My music of choice is Drum'n'Bass.
